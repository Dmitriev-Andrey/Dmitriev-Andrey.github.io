title: Hello World!
---

I've started a long journey!
I will try to change my imperative developer mind. I've been developing in Java for about 5 years and I think I need to enrich my experience. 
I want to explore the asynchronous programming world. I'll start from the Java environment (Netty, Spring Web Flux, etc.), but my common goal - finding problems for the concept. 
This blog will describe my path, interesting features, methods, and solutions.
