I've started a long journey!

I will try to change my imperative developer mind.
I've been developing in Java for about 5 years and I think I need to enrich my experience.
I want to learn functional programming in Scala and related technologies (Akka, Spark, etc.).
This blog will describe my path, interesting features, methods and solutions.
